#### METEOR TAP Assessment 2023
For this technical assessment, I chose to attempt the backend (REST API) project.
This project is written in JavaScript for NodeJs, using Express.js framework with MySQL database.

## Table of contents
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Dependencies](#dependencies)

## Getting Started
In the project directory, you may run the following commands:

### `npm install` 
   - This command will install all necessary dependencies.
   - You only need to run this <b>once</b> in the project directory.
### `npm start`
   - This command starts the node server.
   - Alternatively, you may use `nodemon app.js` or `node app.js`.
   - For more variations of nodemon commands, please refer to [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#nodemon).
